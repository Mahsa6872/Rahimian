Git assignment
In this , I will copy some of my first assignments about myself, including photos. My goal of
taking this course is to equip myself with the knowledge and tools essential for the successful
realization of my upcoming research which is about software defined networking (SDN) and
integrating this topic with Path-Aware Risk Scores for Access Control. Integrating these
two topics could make access controls way more secure by considering not just who’s trying
to access something, but also the path they’re taking and the situation around it. This is
my first semester at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS), and I’m eager
to start working on this exciting topic. What I’m hoping to get out of this course is a bunch
of tools and knowledge to supercharge my research skills. I want to learn all about different
ways to do research, improve how I read and understand things, and get better at writing my
ideas down. Just to give you a little background, I’ve been on a bit of an academic journey
already. I spent two years as a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado Denver, and
before that, I got my master’s degree in Information Technology from Colorado Technical
University. I’m thrilled to be here, eager to learn, and really looking forward to using what
I learn to make a real impact in the world of computer science. I utilized Google Scholar as
a valuable tool for locating research papers pertinent to my area of interest. For effective
management of bibliographic data and associated research materials like PDF files, I tried to
use Zotero to be an invaluable reference management tool. To enhance my remote research
capabilities, I set up the UCCS VPN, granting me access to UCCS resources even when
working off-campus.
2 Tools/ My research interest
In the initial stages of using Google Scholar, I encountered a challenge in refining my search
results to precisely match my research criteria. However, I overcame this hurdle by employ-
ing the advanced search features, which significantly improved the relevance of the retrieved
papers. Navigating LaTeX proved to be another obstacle, particularly since I had not used
2
it extensively for some time. Yet, through the aid of YouTube tutorials, I managed to regain
my familiarity with LaTeX, enabling me to confidently resume working with it. Through
these tools and strategies, I have taken significant strides in streamlining my research pro-
cess, from efficient paper discovery to effective reference management. Overcoming chal-
lenges has only served to enhance my adaptability and proficiency in my academic pursuits.
I would like to describe the three most related papers to my research. First, I would like to
start with a paper titled Path-Aware Risk Scores for Access Control in Zero-Trust Archi-
tectures [?]. In summary, the paper introduces a context-sensitive technique that enhances
access control in zero-trust architectures by assigning risk scores to paths taken by access
requests. This approach addresses the need for fine-grained monitoring and enforcement and
demonstrates improved path selection compared to traditional routing algorithms. another
paper that was intersting to me was Sidecar-based Path-aware Security for Microservices [?].
the paper introduces a novel approach to improve the security of microservice architectures.
The proposed infrastructure focuses on path-based anomaly detection and access control
without the need for modifying existing software. By deploying trusted proxies and using
signed tokens for path validation, the approach reduces the attack surface and enhances the
security and resiliency of microservice-based applications that handle sensitive data. and
the third paper that I would like to describe it breifly is EPIC: Every Packet Is Checked in
the Data Plane of a Path-Aware Internet [?]. The paper focuses on path-aware networking,
a new network architecture that offers solutions to security issues in today’s Internet while
improving efficiency and giving end users control over data paths. The authors highlight
three important issues: the need for network operators to apply their own rules for efficient
path selection, the ability of end users to verify data forwarding, and the authentication of
packet sources by intermediate routers and recipients.
